# StudyEdge
CEN3031 Group 

## Project Goals
1. Create an easy to use administration backend that allows the team at StudyEdge to view analytics.
	* The backend should contain these functionalities at bare minimum:
	1. Easily view the specific content that is being viewed, and include sorting features to make such a task easier. 
	* *Example: View the specific Study Edge Videos being watched: sort by number of views, average completion, etc* 
	2. Ability to view which StudyEdge Modules are being utilized most. Similar functionality mindset to content. 
	* *Example: See whether videos, flashcards or practice is the most used module. By how many hours? How many students?*
1. Create an easy to use frontend UI experience for the admins who will utilize this system. 
	1. Employ UX empathetic design philosophy to make the site intutive and headache free. 
	1. UX will be working directly with UI to ensure that the project is not only great to look at, 
	but also great to **Use** . 
	1. Ensure the design works across multiple resolutions, browsers and devices. 
1. Ensure this is all done securely with proper authentication and safety precautions. 

## Contributing 
This section is still a work in progress considering there's a lot we have yet to decide on project wise. 
I believe it would be wise to use a good auto formatting tool that we can share a config for, just so the code
we commit and push is uniform and easy to read. Some things I think we can all agree upon (feel free to disagree)

* Tabs, not spaces (You can format tabs to be however many spaces you'd like, but not the other way around.) 
* Maximum number of blank lines between lines of code: ***2*** 
* Comment Style: Verbose. Describe each declaration (if necessary), and describe what each file contains at the header of each file. 
* Allow both block and line comments. 

### Contributing on GitHub
We will use the GitFlow model of Git. A good resource for learning more about that can be found [at this link that is conveniently highlighted.](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
If you want a quick TL;DR: 
* Each big feature addition is created on its own branch. You commit to the feature branch until said feature is complete and stable enough to merge back into our master branch (we should create a develop master branch). 
* Once it's ready for master branch, create a pull request with a report of what you're adding, and notify everyone of what you have tested with/if there's anything that still needs to be tested. 
* At the end, you end with this current graph that looks a lot like a waterfall. 

## README To-Do! 
Once we meet up, we'll need to talk about specifics we want to employ in the project. This will largely be dictated by the Study Edge API, and if we need to expand it at all.
