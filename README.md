# TweetEdge


## A Twitter Analytics app utilizing the Twitter API
## Created with AngularJS, Express.js, Node.js, HTML, and CSS

The purpose of TweetEdge is to provide an easy to use twitter analytics platform, allowing users to easily search trends, locational trends, and few graphs curating the information. 

### Issues
For some reason this app does not work properly on its Heroku deployment. If you would like to see the functionality of this code, consider downloading this repository to your local machine.
The application can be run by using 'node server' within the code directory and visiting localhost:PORT and replacing PORT with the PORT that the app is listening on (Probably 8000 or 8080).

### Current features 

- Search regional trends
- View graphics for regional trends, expand and collapse data
- Search trends by topic
- View graphics for topics, showcasing top tweets
- All tweets link back to their respective post on Twitter. 

### Contributing 
Utilize fmt from the NPM. fmt will automatically format your files to the Node/JS standard upon save. 
To find something to work on, check out our pivotaltracker (Organization account so no link). From there you'll be able to assign yourself to an issue, or make a new one if what you want to work on isn't there visibly. 

### To-Do
- Fix login
- Deploy to Heroku (routing/environment issues are preventing deploy)
- Add more features
- Make the UI more mobile-friendly.
